<div>
    Specifies the order that modules are started. Lower weighted modules are started before higher weighted modules.

If the application deployment descriptor specifies the &lt;initialize-in-order&gt;true&lt;/initialize-in-order&gt; element, the default starting weights reflect the order that is specified in the deployment descriptor. Otherwise, the defaults are determined based on module type (RAR modules start before EJB modules, which start before web modules).
